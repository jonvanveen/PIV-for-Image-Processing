# PIV-for-Image-Processing

This project implements Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) analysis across a series of images of a herd of sheep moving through a gate. It was created with peers for an Image Processing course in the fall of 2020.

It involved calculating relative velocities at different levels, starting with "particles" (individual sheep) up to the entire flock. The design process included both custom functions and built-in Matlab functions.

The project contains a single Matlab live script, ECE533_Final_Project.mlx. It was run using MATLAB_R2020a on local machines.
